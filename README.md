## [Brief intro](https://github.com/raidionics/LyNoS#brief-intro)

This repository contains the LyNoS dataset described in ["_Mediastinal lymph nodes segmentation using 3D convolutional neural network ensembles and anatomical priors guiding_"](https://doi.org/10.1080/21681163.2022.2043778). The original pretrained model was made openly available [here](https://github.com/dbouget/ct_mediastinal_structures_segmentation). However, we have gone ahead and made a web demonstration to more easily test the pretrained model. The application was developed using [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app) for the frontend and the segmentation is performed using the [Raidionics](https://raidionics.github.io/) backend.

## [Development](https://github.com/raidionics/LyNoS#development)

### [Docker](https://github.com/raidionics/LyNoS#docker)

Alternatively, you can deploy the software locally. Note that this is only relevant for development purposes. Simply dockerize the app and run it:

```
docker build -t LyNoS .
docker run -it -p 7860:7860 LyNoS
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:7860` in your favourite internet browser to view the demo.

### [Python](https://github.com/raidionics/LyNoS#python)

It is also possible to run the app locally without Docker. Just setup a virtual environment and run the app.
Note that the current working directory would need to be adjusted based on where `LyNoS` is located on disk.

```
git clone https://github.com/raidionics/LyNoS.git
cd LyNoS/

virtualenv -python3 venv --clear
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r ./demo/requirements.txt

python demo/app.py --cwd ./
```
